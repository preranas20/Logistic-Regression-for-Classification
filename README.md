# Logistic-Regression-for-Classification
Implementation of Logistic Regression Algorithm for Binary Classification Analysis on Iris Dataset.

Binary classification is performed on virginica and versicolor flowers using petal length and petal width in Iris Dataset.

Leave-one-out cross validation is used to get average error rate.

Training and Testing is performed after scaling the petal length and petal width so that each variable spans in [0,1]
